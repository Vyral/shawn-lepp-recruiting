<p>Dear Real Estate Agent:</p>

<p>Are you looking for training that teaches you exactly what you need to do to sell homes specifically right here in {{site.data.settings.client.market}}?</p>

<p>I invite you to subscribe to our free real estate agent training newsletter.</p>

<p>Every two weeks, we publish helpful tips for you. These include:
<ol class="indent">
<li>Real agent success stories</li>
<li>Question and answer videos</li>
<li>Highlights of our team training</li>
<li>Our favorite technology tips</li>
</ol></p>

<p>Our goal is to give you a taste of the training we provide if you have any interest in working with us in the future.</p>

<p><strong>We have no intention of recruiting you</strong> - that’s a conversation with us when you are ready, if at all.</p>

<p>Last year 11,136 homes sold in the Durham Region market.</p>

<p>That’s plenty of business to go around for all of us.</p>

<p>We’ve been fortunate to sell 185 homes last year and an agent who works full time can earn over $100,000 a year with us.</p>

<p>The same training they get will help you do it as well.</p>

<p>So, if you’re interested in knowing what we’re up to here, and you’d like to stay current on the latest strategies to:
<ol class="indent">
<li>Generate qualified seller leads</li>
<li>Attract buyers who actually want to buy</li>
<li>Convert more leads to appointments</li>
<li>Win more listing presentations at full commission</li>
<li>Systematize your administrative processes</li>
<li>Earn more referrals and reviews for repeat business</li>
</oL></p>

<p>…I invite you to subscribe to our free newsletter below.</p>

<p><strong>Here’s what a few agents say about our free training:</strong></p>

<p class="testimonial-text indent">"Since I have joined the Shawn Lepp Group my volume of sales has more than doubled in the first year alone. Going from an average of 5-6 deals a year to 35 deals in my first 12 months. My skills and confidence have significantly increased due to the support, training and coaching our team has to offer. With the systems, Lead Generation and Branding supporting me, I can set even higher targets for the upcoming year." <span class="testimonial-author">- Richard Tait</span></p>

<p class="testimonial-text indent">"I have worked on the team for 10 years now. I have consistently year over year met my goals and most years exceeded my goals. The accountability and training have been key to my success in real estate." <span class="testimonial-author">- Marion Penny</span></p>

<!-- <p class="testimonial-text indent">“This training is great!” <span class="testimonial-author">- Bob</span></p> -->

<p>You are also welcome to subscribe to our Agent Training Podcast on iTunes and we also publish our free training content on our local mastermind Facebook page if you prefer to stay in touch that way, too.</p>

<p>Most importantly, everything you receive is designed to start a conversation. So, if you have any questions about selling real estate you can email me at <a href="mailto:shawn@shawnlepp.com">shawn@shawnlepp.com</a>. </p>

<p>I’ll first answer your question by email, and if I think it would be of benefit to more people, I’ll answer it in a video.</p>

<p>We look forward to staying in touch. Let’s raise the standard and training of all real estate agents in our Durham Region.</p>
