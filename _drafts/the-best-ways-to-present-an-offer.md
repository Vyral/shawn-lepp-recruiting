<center>How should you present an offer to your clients? Find out today.</center>

Things have changed when it comes to putting in an offer on a home. We used to go directly to the house to make an offer, but many agents are now sending them in digitally. Instead of giving us 24 hours to respond, we’re seeing short, irrevocable offers.

**The first thing I recommend is to have the right amount of time to present offers to your client**. Go over the offer with them so they understand it. Before I send an offer to a client, I make sure the legal description is correct and the right names are on there.

Clients will usually focus on the price first and foremost, but they’re forgetting about other parts of the offer. After I let them read it, I’ll go over the other details that are worth mentioning. We want to start off with the terms of the deposit.

Next, we look at the chattels to find out if things like fridges and stoves are staying. We cover things about the commission, the title search, and the fine print. I point out the signature to show that it’s an official offer—you want it in writing.&nbsp;

Next, we look at the Schedule A form. This is where you’ll see some conditions, including financing and home inspections. We go over the Schedule B form as well. Finally, we make sure they understand who is representing who in the transaction.&nbsp;

**The ultimate goal is to have them be aware of everything before they sign and agree to the offer**. If you have any questions or would like more information, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
