What’s it like working on our team? Longtime member Marion Penny tells us that and more in today’s Q&A.

I was happy to have the opportunity to sit down with friend and colleague Marion Penny for a short Q&A session. Marion is a longtime member of our team and has been an instrumental part of our success at The Shawn Lepp Group.

***Q. How long have you been on our team?***

I’ve been with the team for over 10 years now.

***Q. How did you choose our team?***

As a matter of fact, I didn’t. Shawn and my husband, Ian, knew each other from their days playing hockey together as kids. Shawn approached Ian and asked if I would consider venturing out into real estate. I decided I’d like to take a stab at it and get licensed, and I’ve been with the team ever since.

***Q. What has led to your success?***

My success stems from the hard work everyone brings to the table, dedication, gelling with and knowing I can rely on the team, our culture on the team-level and brokerage-level, my individual relationships, and those around me keeping me grounded.

***Q. What training has helped you the most?***

I help run the scripting classes, and that has contributed mightily to our team chemistry and cohesion. We have fun, but we also recognize that there’s a time and a place and we get the job done. Also, my weekly meetings with Shawn and having an admin like Brenda take care of the particulars both serve to keep me on track.

***Q. How does the admin staff help you do what you do best—buying, selling, and building relationships?***

I try not to multitask, so it’s nice to be able to call up the admins for help with such things as looking up listings or getting a message across in a clause. That’s been so important to me.

***Q. &nbsp;What has been the best thing about our team?***

It’s been the relationships. On top of having a great relationship with Shawn and with everyone else on the team, I’ve built great relationships with my clients as well; some of which have blossomed wonderful friendships. I also am safe in the knowledge that I’ve built a great database and should I ever decide to pursue other avenues, I can take that with me. Aside from the team, we also go on vacations sponsored by Keller Williams and get to learn from other agents in the larger brokerage.

A big thanks to Marion for answering some of my questions today. She’s been integral to our team’s success each and every day, and we look forward to many more years working with her.

If you have any questions for either me or Marion, please don’t hesitate to get in touch with us here at The Shawn Lepp Group. Thanks for tuning in for our Q&A today\!
