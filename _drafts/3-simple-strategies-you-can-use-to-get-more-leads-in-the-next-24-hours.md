<center>If you want to earn more leads, follow these three simple tips.</center>

Almost everyone I know could use a few more leads right now. So if you’re looking to generate more leads yourself, there are a number of simple ways you can do so within the next 24 hours.

The first tip is to **text 25 people you haven’t spoken to in a while** and let them know you’re still available to assist in meeting their real estate goals.

Another quick tip to try is to **email 100 seller leads from your database**. Let these people know that it’s currently a great time to move up because, as you likely already know, homes in mid-range price brackets are earning top dollar right now, while higher-priced homes have actually been seeing slightly less activity. You can use this information to help convince seller leads that now’s the perfect time to get off the fence.

Similarly, you should also **send out a text or email to 100 of your buyer leads**. This message can be simple. All you need to do is let them know that interest rates have dropped three times this month, making it a great time to buy. Then, ask if they’re still thinking of making a move, and let them know that, if they are, you’re available to help.

By following these three simple steps, agents on my own team have booked multiple appointments already. We’ve seen how effective these tips can be, and we’re certain that they can work for you, too.
