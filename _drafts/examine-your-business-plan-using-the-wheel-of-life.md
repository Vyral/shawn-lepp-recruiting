What is the wheel of life and how can you use it to create more balance in your life and business?

As the third quarter winds down, my team and I made our own wheel of life to examine our business plan, and **we added five key categories within the wheel:**

**1\. Wealth:** We look at our future investments (the stock market, houses, pensions, etc.) and determine where we’re at financially.

**2\. Business:** Is our business going in the right direction? How is our profit margin looking?

**3\. Personal Growth:** We talk about education, our families, and the different things we want to grow with.

**4\. Health:** Everyone has different health goals, and we compare our goals for this year versus our goals for next year.

**5\. Family:** One of the reasons I started the Shawn Lepp Group is my family.

Within each category, we added a scale of one to 10 (one being the worst, 10 being the best) and had each team member use that scale to mark how satisfied they were with how the category applied to their own lives. Nobody wrote down perfect 10s for every category, of course, but this wheel is a great way to examine where you’re at in your life.

As we get into business-planning mode for 2020, it’s time to find out what’s important in your life and what you can work on. If you have any questions about this or any other real estate topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.
