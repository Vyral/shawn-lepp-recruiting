If you want to host an effective open house, you need to follow these key steps.

Many agents ask whether open houses are a worthwhile tactic, and while we at the Shawn Lepp Group do believe them to be effective, it’s important to go about hosting an open house the right way.

**Our team takes a few critical steps to ensure each open house is as effective as possible**.

First, we print flyers and gauge local interest in the property by doorknocking and making phone calls within the neighborhood. Not only do we invite the people we contact to the upcoming open house, but we also encourage them to get in touch with us if they or anyone they know is thinking of selling, themselves. **Open houses aren’t just a good marketing tool—they’re a great prospecting tool, as well**.

Once you’ve prepared for the open house, the day of the event is just as important. Agents who host open houses must be aware that many buyers (and potential sellers) who show up will treat conversations with them like a job interview. If you want to gain new clients (and do right by your current clients), you need to dress well and act the part during every open house.

But **the job isn’t over after the open house has wrapped up**. The days following the event are actually the most important to your business. Following up with people who attended within one or two business days after the weekend of the open house is critical. The efficacy of contacting leads drops by about 90% after this time frame.

So the bottom line is this: Open houses can be extremely effective, but only if you follow the proper steps.
