<center>Let’s review our business plans one last time before we close the book on 2019.</center>

Now that the kids are back in school and 2019 is winding down, it’s time to take a long, hard look at whether we’re on pace to hit our end-of-year goals.

Have you already or will you achieve what you set out to achieve? If not, how will you adjust your business plan to see your goals for 2019 through? In the next few months, other agents will start to write their business plan for the upcoming year, so **it’s important to look back today so you can look forward two months from now**. I certainly hope you surpassed your personal and professional goals, but if you haven’t, there’s still time to finish strong. I’d be happy to help you with that.

If you have any questions or would like help with your goal setting and business plan, please feel free to give me a call at (905) 409-6778. Here’s to hoping you have a great month\!
