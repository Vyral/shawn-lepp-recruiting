I recently sat down with one of our team’s great sales representatives, Jodie Harvey, and I can’t wait to share her thoughts on the Shawn Lepp Group with all of you today.

Over the next couple of months, I’ll be introducing you to a few of our great team members here at the Shawn Lepp Group. For my first introduction, I decided to meet with sales representative Jodie Harvey to talk about her experience with us.

**According to Jodie, who has been on our team for almost two years now, she was first attracted to the Shawn Lepp Group because of our collaborative atmosphere**. The shared knowledge, the trainings, and the 411 meetings we do every week have all helped her to thrive.

But as helpful as these resources have been, Jodie still says that her favorite part of the Shawn Lepp Group is the people who make it up. “The culture on our team is fantastic. Everyone supports each other,” says Jodie.

It’s exactly this support, in fact, that has kept Jodie on our team as opposed to striking out on her own. **“The support staff has enabled me to work more with clients without worry about the little stuff that goes on in the background,”** Jodie says of her experience.

It’s great to hear how excited Jodie is about being a part of our team, and her story isn’t the only one we’ve got to share.I can’t wait to share even more testimonies from other members of the Shawn Lepp Group in future posts.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me or my team a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
