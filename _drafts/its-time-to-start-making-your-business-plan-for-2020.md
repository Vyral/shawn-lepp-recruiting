If you haven’t started making your business plan for 2020, don’t wait any longer.

Have you started making your business plan for 2020?

All the activities we do now dictate how we do next year. Unfortunately, though, many agents prefer to wait until January to start planning for the new year and end up missing the whole first quarter. On our team, it’s important that we both finish strong in 2019 and start strong in 2020, and that’s why we’re working on our business plan right now.

As I mentioned in my previous video, we use the Wheel of Life as a gauge to figure out how many deals we want to close, how much income we need to make, how much profit that will leave us, and whether that will support the lifestyle we prefer to live. Then we examine how many leads we have, where our lead generation comes from, and how much it costs us.

There are quite a few factors we must consider when formulating a business plan, so if you’d like to learn more about the process, you’re invited to our upcoming business clinic on \[DATE\] at \[LOCATION\].

If you have any questions about this topic in the meantime, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to speak with you.
