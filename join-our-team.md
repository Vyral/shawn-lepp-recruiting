<p>Dear Fellow or Future Real Estate Agent,</p>

<p>We understand that you may be frustrated right now with your current brokerage or team. Perhaps you feel as if you aren’t receiving much, if any, support in building the wealth and success you deserve. You might lack the training, coaching, and systems to get you there.</p>

<p>Many new agents are overwhelmed with all the information in real estate school. There’s pressure to choose a broker immediately after getting your license and it’s hard to know whether you’ll be able to earn the income necessary. Maybe you’re afraid of not earning enough income or converting as many leads as you need to. Maybe you’ve already switched companies once or twice with little to no success to show for it.</p>

<p>If any of this sounds like you, you aren’t alone. In fact, 87% of real estate agents fail within their first two years in the business. They either run out of money or don’t have the support or structure needed to be successful in this business long-term. An agent needs many things in order to be successful, including training, support, coaching with accountability, structure, and leads. If you don’t have that, you’ll be ready to walk away from the industry.</p>

<p>Going into real estate can feel either like the best or the worst career move you’ve ever made. So, how can you be sure that your real estate career won’t end in disaster? You join a quality brokerage—one with the right resources, training, and culture to help you grow as an agent.</p>

<p>With the proper tools, your real estate career can go from barely surviving to absolutely thriving. We have those tools here at The Shawn Lepp Group. Over the last 15 years, our team has a consistent track record of being in the top-25 of our real estate Board. Our team has always had great success, and we constantly watch new agents go from 0 or a few deals to 30, 40, or 50 deals in their first year.</p>

<p>The systems we have in place has allowed us to consistently sell hundreds of homes per year while allowing our agents to focus on their jobs instead of getting bogged down by paperwork and minutiae. Whether you are a new agent, an experienced one, or are just thinking of entering the world of real estate, we can help you find success with our systems, our leads, and our experience. If you have a strong work ethic and you’re ready to start earning income right away, here’s what we’ll provide for you:
<ul class="indent">
<li>Weekly consulting program</li>
<li>Weekly accountability meetings</li>
<li>Workbooks for listings, open houses, and more</li>
<li>A full marketing plan that’s always generating leads</li>
<li>A full staff of assistants to help move transactions along quickly and efficiently</li>
<li>Plug-and-play systems that you can install directly into your business</li>
</ul></p>


<p>By joining The Shawn Lepp Group, you’ll be on the fast track to success in real estate. Here are your alternatives:</p>

<p>You can work for a competing brokerage and/or go out on your own. However, you won’t get the same amount of support or guidance, and your career may stall out as a result.</p>

<p>You can put five to six years of extremely hard work in to build your own team and brand, but you’ll be taking much of what you earn and putting it right back into the building of your business.</p>

<p>Or, you can join our team, where we will provide you with the training, the systems, and the guidance necessary to take your career to a place that you never thought it would be.</p>

<p>But, don’t just take my word for it. Consider the stories of Jody and Richard. It’s her first year in the business, and she’s on track to completing over 20 deals in her first year with our team. Richard was brought on last year and averaging five deals per year in six years in the business. This year alone, he’s listed 29 homes in his first year with our team.</p>

<p>If you join The Shawn Lepp Group, you’ll be joining a brokerage with impeccable service, strong name recognition, and a great reputation in the community. We have a 30-, 60-, or 90-day onboarding process based on your experience, and we will use that time to teach you our systems to make sure you know exactly how the process works and exactly what you should be doing. You’ll hit the ground running and be on the fast track to generating business.</p>

<p>You also may be interested in having a look at some of our most frequently asked questions like, “Will my name be on the marketing materials?” or “Will you provide me with leads?”</p>

<p>We can answer those questions for you and any other questions you may have about our team if you just give us a call or send us an email today. We look forward to hearing from you soon.</p>

<p>Regards,</p>
