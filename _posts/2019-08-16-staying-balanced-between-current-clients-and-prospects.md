How do you keep the balance between current clients and prospects during these beautiful summer months? To answer that question, I’ll tell you what our team does.

When we come into the office, we make sure we’re very purposeful. We time block in the morning to deal with our prospects and keep the pipeline moving so when we hit the fall market, we’re ready for it. Our schedule during this time usually involves 30 minutes of script training, followed by two hours of prospecting our leads and managing our follow-up systems.

Once the afternoon hits, we deal with our current clients. With interest rates as low as they are, we’re seeing a lot of motivated buyers and sellers gravitating back into the market.

With this system, we still have evenings and weekends to ourselves. Some agents work more during weekends and take a couple days off during the week, but they’re able to time block that schedule based on their families’ needs.

So if you want to achieve the same balance and stay consistent, make sure you time block for both your current clients and your prospects.

If you have any questions about this or any other real estate topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help you.
