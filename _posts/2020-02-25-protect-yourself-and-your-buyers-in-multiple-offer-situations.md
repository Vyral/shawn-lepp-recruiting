<br>Our spring market is already crazy, and multiple-offer situations are popping up everywhere. When representing buyers in this scenario, you need to protect both them and yourself. Here are a few things to keep in mind in order to do so.

First of all, does your buyer need to do a home inspection? Have they seen the home well enough? It might cost a few extra dollars, but **we recommend getting a pre-inspection**. Make sure your buyer knows exactly what’s in that house. I also highly advise you to have the inspector record any issues in writing.

During multiple-offer situations, a lot of agents are taking out their financing conditions. If you do this, **make sure you have a great mortgage broker behind you** and you’re using one of your partners. Also, make sure the broker is OK with this and that they’re fine if the house doesn’t appraise. Right now, banks will probably be twice as hard as they were a couple of years ago regarding appraisals, so you need to educate your buyers about what it means to take out their financing condition.

Additionally, **make sure you’re not competing with other agents in your office**, ask the listing agent if they have any offers from agents in your office. Most offers will be faxed in, so you’ll want a disclosure from that agent before you and your buyer move forward.

Lastly, **try to get bigger deposits**—some people are getting deposit checks beforehand.

As always, if you have questions about this or any other real estate topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.
