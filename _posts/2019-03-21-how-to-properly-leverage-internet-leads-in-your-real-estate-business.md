Internet marketing is quite a departure from the older, more traditional styles of marketing where we’d place ads in the newspaper and receive calls from people ready to do business.

In the digital age, the lion’s share of buyers and sellers are taking to the internet to do their own research. Because of this, **we’re able to catch them at an earlier stage in the process than what was true in the past**. Therefore, the follow-up requires a different approach.

Commonly, an agent will call an internet lead once and follow that up with a single email, often to no avail. The inherently frustrating nature of internet leads poses a problem for agents as well. **A good conversion rate tends to range from 3% to 5%**, so, say you receive 100 leads. In all likelihood, you’ll have success with a few of those, but you’ll have to wade through the other 95% in the process.

Once you’ve received a lead, funnel it through your database; calling the lead once won’t be conducive to a sale. Instead, call them two or three times over the course of a month with some added value to each call. Also, **you’ll want to start a drip campaign and target them with videos and emails so as to develop a touch system**. In this way, you’ll be able to market to them periodically throughout the year.

Sometimes, it takes our buyers and sellers anywhere from six months to a year-and-a-half before they’re ready to enter into a transaction. This is what distinguishes internet marketing from traditional methods—on average, it’s not until the seventh call that an internet lead transforms. It can be a slow process. For this reason, **having a system within your database makes a huge difference with your conversion rates**.

Not much ever comes of internet leads without a system except for empty marketing spending. You’ll end up landing the leads, call them once, and next thing you know, you’ve spent $5,000 or more with no transaction to show for it. We have the systems in place to help you stay in front of these leads, and would be happy to share more information about these systems with you.

If you have any more questions about internet marketing, please feel free to give me a call at (905) 409-6778. I’d be happy to help!
