&nbsp;

How do multiple-offer situations work? What’s the best way to help guide your seller clients through them so they pick the best available offer and maximize their home sale?

Once you receive your first offer, you have to register it with your brokerage. After that, you can page it out to all the other buyer agents. Once you get a second offer, you then enter into a multiple-offer situation.

**When you get all the offers, the first thing you want to do is send them to your client and disclose whether there are any collateral agreements**. For example, when you listed the house, if you said you’d list it at 5%—and 4%, if we do it ourselves—you have to disclose that to all the agents. This is why we try to keep all of our commissions at the same rate.

On the listing side, you also have to disclose whether one of the offers is from someone on your own team. On the buyer side, if any agents from the same company make offers, that’s something you need to disclose too, and not just verbally—it also has to be disclosed in writing to everyone involved. No matter what side of the transaction you’re on, make sure you have all the proper disclosures before you even start the process.

**Once you have all the offers, go through each of them with your client and take note of what changes they want from each**. After this, what we do is notify each agent of what changes we’re asking and ask them to resubmit their offer within a certain time frame. A lot of times, the main determining factors are price, terms, and conditions.
