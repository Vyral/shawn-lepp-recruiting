<br>How do we get so many listings?

It’s a very hot market out there, and whenever someone asks me this question, I ask them: Do you have a listing presentation? **Not everyone has a listing presentation set up on their tablet or computer, and if you don’t, I highly recommend getting one**.

What goes into this presentation? Include a little bit about yourself or your team. After that, tell people what you’ll do to get their home sold. Add information that details items such as:

* What kind of pictures/videos you’ll take
* How you’ll display their home on your website
* Whether you’ll do marketing online or use print advertising
* Whether you’ll stage the house

Show them every step you’ll take from day one so they know what to expect from you and what your expectations are of them once they leave that listing appointment. I’d also add some market statistics—inventory numbers are always key in showing them where the market is going. Add some statistics about yourself as well. If you’re a newer agent and don’t have statistics of your own, use your office’s. Many offices have IMS statistics available.

The bottom line is that&nbsp;**if you come to a listing appointment prepared with a listing presentation, that will give the seller confidence to list with you**.

If you have any more questions about this topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.
