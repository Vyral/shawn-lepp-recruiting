<center><em>Here are some great ideas on how to contact your clients this holiday season.</em></center>

<br>It's December, so you may be working, preparing for an upcoming vacation, or holiday shopping. Right now you might be wondering: Do our clients want to hear from us? You’d be shocked how many clients *do* want to hear from you. The most difficult part is, what do we say? **What do we do this time of year so we can feel like we’re sending something beneficial?**

**Here are a few things you can do:**

* Get a calendar list ready. You can send this to your clients and sphere of influence.
* Send a holiday card. You can wish them a happy holiday season.
* Host a client event. This is something we like to do. It’s a reason to call them. Invite them to come enjoy food, drinks, and cheer. It’s an excellent way to see them face to face and discuss what’s happening in their lives.
* Send a newsletter. Let them know what’s happening in the market and what you predict will happen next year.
