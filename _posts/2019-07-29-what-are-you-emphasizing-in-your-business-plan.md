Now that we’re just past the halfway point of the year, it’s a good time to **review your business plan** if you haven’t already done so. Are you on track to meet your goals?

When thinking about their business plan, a lot of agents assume there’s nothing to consider beyond their transaction total and the money they’ve made from those transactions. However, this is looking at it through a short-term lens.

For our part, **we sit down with each of our agents and make a point of discussing their business plan in terms of the big picture**. That means asking them what they’re doing for their financial security down the road. An alarming number of agents aren’t properly planning for retirement and are instead simply scraping by from one year to the next.

**Do yourself a favor by carefully evaluating your business plan, looking at your financials, and asking yourself if your earnings are sufficient to support you into retirement**. The worst thing you could do is brush these concerns aside for another five years and find yourself in the same position in another 10 years. Start investing in RSPs, stocks, or real estate now to set yourself up for financial security later.

The bottom line is that your business plan should not only encompass your short-term goals, but your retirement goals as well.
