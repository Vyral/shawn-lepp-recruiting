One thing to do in order to keep a productive relationship with your database is to use the 33-touch system. To increase your business with past clients and referrals, look at what you’re sending them. According to the Red Book, for every 12 people you have in your database under your sphere of influence, you should be getting one piece of business, plus one referral. Your success with this ratio is determined by what you’re sending your database.

To some, making 33 touches sounds like a lot, but it’s actually quite simple when you put the people’s information in your CRM. One way to establish a connection with your database is to **send out a professional, print newsletter once a month**. In this newsletter, you can include some of your sold homes and your current listings, and it’s also a good idea to keep your clients informed about the market. This will help keep your brand top-of-mind.

Additionally, **send out another, separate monthly newsletter via email**. After the print and email newsletters, you’re already at 24 touches for the year.

However, don’t be afraid to pick up the phone. **Make calls to your clients at a minimum of four times a year**—once per quarter—and divide that up based on how many past clients you have in your database. For example, we have almost 2,000 past clients in our database, so we structured our per-day number of calls around that in order to meet all our touches.

Another way to stay in touch with clients is to **send them each a personalized birthday wish**. We also keep track of when they purchased a home so we can recognize the anniversary of their homeownership.

The examples so far have been achievable at a distance, but don’t be afraid to personalize your touches. We **set up four different client events per year** as a way of interacting with them in a fun, interpersonal way.

After you’ve made all 33 of your touches, remember to look back on your database to see who is opening your emails and making use of the other materials you’re spending money on. **Identify which touches are working best so that you can channel your expenses into methods that produce results and provide value**.

Providing value to clients is absolutely key. When we do speak with our clients, we always ask what they would like to receive from us, be it market statistics, a referral package, or something else. Based on that feedback, we can then re-evaluate our touches for the next year.

If you have any questions about maintaining your database, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be glad to offer you my advice.
