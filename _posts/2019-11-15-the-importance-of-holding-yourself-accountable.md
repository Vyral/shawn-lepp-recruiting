<center><em>I highly recommend hiring a peer to hold you accountable. Here&rsquo;s why.</em></center>

<br>I want to begin today’s message by thanking everyone who came to our recent business clinic. I hope you learned a lot, and I hope you have a chance to apply what you learned.

After we host these clinics, I find that one of the hardest things to do is hold yourself accountable. To hold myself accountable, I meet with a coach once a week, and our team meets once a week to hold everyone else accountable.

Are you holding yourself accountable? Some agents have a plan for their business, but they have no one to hold them accountable and they’re not quite ready to hire a coach. **I highly recommend hiring a peer (e.g., a team leader or someone in your office) to hold you accountable**.

Oftentimes, agents are gung-ho about their business plan for the first three or four days, but once the next week comes, it gets shelved. Then, all of a sudden, it’s January of next year before they get back to that plan. In this situation, by the time you start making calls and doing your follow-ups, it’ll be 60 days before you close anything.

This is why it’s so important to make your business plan now. **What you do now will produce results in the first quarter of next year**, and you need someone to hold you accountable in terms of setting your goals.

If you’d like to talk more about how to hold yourself accountable or you have any other questions I can answer, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.
