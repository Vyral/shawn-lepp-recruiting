When it comes to selecting a farming area, the first thing you’ll want to look at is **the number of houses there are in the area**. If you have a farm area where 10% of the homes sell—for example, if 100 out of 1,000 total homes sell—that’s a great farm area to begin marketing. Now, if there’s only a 1% turnover rate, you’ll be spending a lot of money and time on an area with a paltry return for your investment. Try picking an area with an excellent school district, as a start.

The next thing to examine is **how big you should go**.

Well, **the bigger you go, the bigger the budget you’ll need**. Agents beginning a farming campaign would do better to start off small, picking 100 to 500 hundred homes in the area you choose, based on the amount of money you have. Longer-term farms may warrant bigger areas. For example, our farm area has gotten as big as 30,000 households to contact each month, but there’s a big cost in terms of materials to sustain that.

Once you’ve chosen an area with a good turnover, you’ll then need to **start thinking about your strategy**. How are you going to get listings? Will you call expired listings or FSBOs? Will you mail out, or door-knock? Each of these tactics works, but you need to be consistent about the ones you use. Also, realize that the process does take time, especially when you’re using physical materials like mailers.

**Many don’t see a great return on their farm area for three or four years before their name is used consistently throughout the households there**. If you want to speed up that process, the more you door-knock and send out mailers, the better; instead of once a month, you might start doing those two or three times a month. Additionally, try to pick some open houses in the area as a means to get more signs out. Remember: The point of farming is to try to create brand awareness.

Nowadays, with social media platforms like Facebook, you can target ads by postal code and locations. **The internet has given us many different ways to become top-of-mind to your farm area**. Picking up the phone is still a tried-and-true method, but you do need to use a “Do Not Call” list.

If you have any questions or would like more information about picking the right farm area, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.
