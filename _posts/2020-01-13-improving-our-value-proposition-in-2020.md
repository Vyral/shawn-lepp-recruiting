<br>I hope everyone had a great holiday season and a happy New Year’s. To start what I hope will be a great 2020, I’m sharing how we’ve begun to change our value proposition.

**Buyers are able to find properties online and make use of an array of real estate apps**; they have access to all the sold information and they can see what’s on the market.

This shift has led us to reflect on how we can better communicate our value to buyers. Most people only buy a house every 5 or 10 years, so making sure our buyer presentations are loaded with step-by-step information is key.

Do they understand how offers work? Do they have any questions about deposits? **We also make sure to discuss how we relieve stress from buyers once they find a house they love**.

If you have any questions about what you should include in your value proposition, feel free to give me a call (905) 409 -6778.
