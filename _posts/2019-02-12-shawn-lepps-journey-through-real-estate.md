Today I'm interviewed by John McMillan about my journey through real estate. From a fresh college graduate to successful real estate broker, I've learned a lot over the years. A few highlights include what attracted me to real estate, starting at Century 21, starting my own team at Keller Williams, and advice for newer agents.
